- 👋 Hi, I’m @JerryCern


- 👀 Grateful for every opportunity to enjoy converting old-school electronics skills into contemporary IoT technoventures, it's more of a hobby than anything else and little more than a hack at the moment, I'm learning. 
- 
- I’m interested in electronics, collecting and hoarding free tech toys, wires and select cables to cobble together as unintended, and for little other reason than to stay ASAP (as sharp as possible).

- some nucleonics, a touch of medicine, astrophysics, science fiction, anime, 


- 🌱 I’m currently learning node-red, javascript, HTML, python and other hobbies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Pi-based remote controlled mower
- 📫 How to reach me? "Don't call us, child, we'll call you..."
