- 👋 Hi, I’m @JerryCern

- 👀 Grateful for every opportunity to enjoy converting old-school electronics skills into contemporary IoT technoventures, it's more of a hobby than anything else and little more than a hack at the moment, I'm learning. I’m interested in electronics, collecting and hoarding free tech toys, wires and select cables to cobble together as unintended, and for little other reason than to stay ASAP (as sharp as possible).

Coming from IBM-PC DOS and surviving literally every edition of M$ Windows, I am sold on the idea of open-source since reacquainted with technical writing in LibreOffice, schematic capture and PCB design in KiCAD, and deeper programing paradigms through Python.

But it was Raspberry Pi made me familiar enough with Linux to be almost functional with the deceptive simplicity of Node-RED, the core motivation to enjoy tinkering with bluetooth by OBD2, rekindle RF thrills from amazing RTL-SDR dongles, explore MQTT through public data streams as the MAS400 project, become familiar with the nature of home automation by Domoticz, and thoroughly dangerous at some other topics born by discovery of IoT devices.

With respect to capabilities the technical industry has never had it so good, and I envy people earnestly employed in deeper parts of its cutting edges.

Where years ago I took myself and my endeavors more seriously, now I look back and say "go ahead, have a laugh" because that's what it's all about now. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning node-red, javascript, HTML, python and other hobbies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Pi-based remote controlled mower
- 📫 How to reach me? "Don't call us, child, we'll call you..."
