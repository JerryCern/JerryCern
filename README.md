- 👋 Hi, I’m @JerryCern

- 👀 Grateful for every opportunity to enjoy converting old-school electronics skills into contemporary IoT technoventures it's all more of a hobby than anything else, and little more than a hack at the moment, I'm learning. I’m interested in electronics, collecting and hoarding free tech toys, wires and select cables to cobble together for little other reason than to stay ASAP (as sharp as possible). 
- With respect to capabilities the technical industry has never had it so good, and I envy people earnestly employed in deeper parts of its cutting edges.
- 🌱 Coming from IBM-PC DOS and literally every edition of M$ Windows, I am sold on open-source since reacquainted with technical writing in LibreOffice, schematic capture and PCB design in KiCAD, and deeper programing paradigms through Python, but it was Raspberry Pi that made me familiar enough with Linux to be almost functional.
- The deceptive simplicity of Node-RED was the core motivation to tinker with bluetooth by OBD2, rekindle RF thrills from amazing RTL-SDR dongles, explore MQTT through such public data streams as the MAS400 project, explore home automation by Domoticz, thoroughly dangerous at topics born by discovery of IoT. 
- Where I used to take my endeavors more seriously, I look back and say "come, have a laugh" because that's what it's all about now. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Pi-based remote controlled mower, stalled out by mechanical design considerations.
- 📫 How to reach me? "Don't call us, child, we'll call you..."
